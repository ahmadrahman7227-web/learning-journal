# 5. Boilerplate dan Encoding: Struktur dasar html.

## Struktur dasar HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="id">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Judul Halaman</title>
<body>
  <h1>Halo Dunia!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

- **DOCTYPE**: This is used to tell browsers which version of HTML you're using.
- **html Element**: This represents the top level element or the root of an HTML document. To specify the language for the document, you should use the lang attribute.
- **head Element**: The head section contains important meta data which is behind-the-scenes information needed for browsers and search engines.
- **meta Elements**: These elements represent your site's metadata. These element have details about things like character encoding, and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link and more.
- **title Element**: This element is used to set the text that appears in the browser tab or window.
- **UTF-8 character encoding**: UTF-8, or UCS Transformation Format 8, is a standardized character encoding widely used on the web. Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data. The charset attribute is used inside of a meta element to set the character encoding to UTF-8.
